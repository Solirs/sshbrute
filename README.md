ssslasher (Secure Shell Slasher) is an easy to use multithreaded SSH password bruteforcing tool written mainly in Java, but with the entry point written in python for convenience.
It's quite fast, provides a pretty and clear command line interface, works out of the box with no extra setup outside of python modules.
